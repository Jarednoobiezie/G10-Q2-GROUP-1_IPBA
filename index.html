                        The community at Sitio Bebe is having issues, and these issues are caused by a number of different things. There is a shortage of health professionals as a result of educational limitations and resource allocation shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic, a lack of educational opportunities in the healthcare industry, and economic activities that prioritize livelihoods over basic needs. The dependence on natural resources for livelihoods and external factors like market changes and closures of mines and factories further compound the challenges. These factors collectively contribute to the community's struggles in areas such as healthcare, water scarcity, and economic stability.

                        Scarcity is a broader concept that refers to the fundamental reality of limited resources relative to unlimited wants. Shortage, on the other hand, is a specific and temporary situation that occurs when there's an imbalance between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied of a particular product or service. While scarcity is a constant economic reality, shortages are more situational and arise within specific markets or contexts.

                        A country with an undereducated population but needs a highly skilled labor force can witness a scarcity of labor. On the other hand, shortage usually describes a market situation with the potential to be fixed by increasing supply levels or distribution.

                            Sa kasalukuyan, ang bayan ng Sitio Bebe ay hinaharap ng masalimuot <span class="orange-text">na</span> krisis sa kalusugan at kapaligiran. Araw-araw, kinakaharap ng 
                            mga residente  <span class="orange-text">rito</span> ang hamon ng pagkuha ng tubig mula <span class="orange-text">sa</span> poso, na kinakailangan pang pakuluan upang maging ligtas na inumin. 
                            <span class="orange-text">Ngunit</span>, ito'y may hamon dahil ang bayan na ito ay <span class="red-text">malayo</span> sa natural na pinagkukunan ng tubig, <span class="orange-text">kaya't</span> karaniwan nilang kailangang 
                            umasa sa pag-aangkat ng <span class="red-text">malinis</span> <span class="orange-text">na</span> tubig mula sa lokal <span class="orange-text">na</span> pamahalaan <span class="orange-text">o</span> maging ang pagbubukas ng mga balon. Sa panahon ng tag-init, 
                            mas naging masusing usapin ang kakulangan sa suplay ng tubig, na nagiging sanhi ng tagtuyot.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p-sanaysay">
                            <span class="green-text">Sa kabila</span> ng kasipagan at produktibidad ng mga mamamayan ng Sitio Bebe, karamihan sa kanila ay mga manggagawa sa mga minahan 
                            at pabrika. <span class="orange-text">Ngunit</span> may malalasakit na kakulangan sa mga propesyonal sa kalusugan, na nagiging dahilan ng hindi sapat na pangangalaga 
                            medikal para sa mga residente, lalo na <span class="orange-text">at</span> walang malapit na pasilidad pangkalusugan. <span class="orange-text">Dahil dito</span>, mas mataas ang bilang ng mga 
                            apektado ng mga sakit tulad ng hypertension, acute respiratory infection, <span class="orange-text">at</span> acute lower respiratory tract infection. Sa puntong ito, 
                            kinakailangan ng koordinasyon at tulong mula sa lokal na pamahalaan at komunidad upang hanapin ang mga solusyon sa mga 
                            problemang ito. <span class="green-text">Unang-una</span>, ang pagkakaroon ng permanente at malinis na suplay ng tubig ay pangunahing pangangailangan. 
                            Maaring ito ay makamit sa pamamagitan ng pagtatayo ng isang Water Station System, na magbibigay ng sapat <span class="orange-text">at</span> maayos na suplay ng tubig sa 
                            lahat. Ito'y makakatulong sa pagbawas ng mga kaso ng mga sakit na dulot ng kakulangan sa tubig.

                        <p class="p-sanaysay">
                            Mahalaga <span class="orange-text">rin</span> ang pagkakaroon ng mga health professionals sa komunidad. Ang mga nars, doktor, at iba pang manggagawang 
                            pangkalusugan ay makakapagbigay <span class="orange-text">nang</span> maayos na pangangalaga medikal sa mga residente. Inirerekomenda namin ang pagtatag ng 
                            isang programa na magbibigay ng scholarship <span class="red-text">para sa</span> mga interesadong maging health professionals sa bayan. <span class="orange-text">Dapat ding</span> magkaroon 
                            ng mga pasilidad at gamot na sapat <span class="red-text">para sa</span> pangangailangan ng komunidad. Napakahalaga <span class="orange-text">rin</span> ang koordinasyon sa pagitan ng lokal na 
                            pamahalaan, mga opisyal ng barangay, at ang gobyerno. Mahalaga <span class="orange-text">ring</span> bahagi ng solusyon ang <span class="pangulo">Pangulo ng Pilipinas, si Bongbong Marcos,</span> 
                            upang matugunan ang mga pangunahing problema sa Sitio Bebe. Responsibilidad ng mga lider na ito na masusing alamin ang kalagayan 
                            ng kanilang nasasakupan at magbigay ng makatarungan at epektibong solusyon sa mga problemang kanilang kinakaharap. Ang lokal na 
                            pamahalaan ay dapat maglaan ng pondo <span class="red-text">para sa</span> mga proyekto at programa na naglalayong malutas ang mga isyu. Bukod dito, ang 
                            pagdalo sa mga fundraising event at konsiyerto ay makakatulong sa pagkolekta ng mga kinakailangang pondo para sa mga 
                            pangangailangan ng komunidad. Ang financial assistance at mga fundraising program ay mahalagang bahagi ng solusyon. Hindi 
                            makakamit ang mga pagbabagong ito kung walang sapat na pondo mula sa gobyerno at suporta mula sa komunidad. Nararapat lamang 
                            ang agarang aksyon dahil malapit nang mabaon sa krisis ang bayan.
